                PRIVACY POLICY – Animated Sticker for WhatsApp
            </h1>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Animated Sticker Apps. (“we”, “our” or
                “us”)
                on the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of
                www.yeekgame.com (the “Site”), our mobile applications, and the services, features, or content we
                offer (collectively with the Site, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various
                sources, including: (i) if you register for an account on the Services, through your user account (your
                “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services.
                When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
                disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”)
                gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of
                any Personal Data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control,
                including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (each a “Third Party
                Service”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or
                employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect
                for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party
                Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you
                access.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What Information Do We Collect From You?</h2>
            <p>
                We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties
                such
                as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal
                Data
                about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services. The information we
                gather
                enables us to personalize, improve, understand and continue to operate the Services. In connection with
                certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Data.
                Below
                explains in greater detail the types of information that we collect from our users.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Information You Provide to Us
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Account Information:</h3>
            <p>
                If you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Data, such as your email
                address and a password. You may also choose to provide additional Personal Data, including your contact
                name, information about yourself, basic demographic information including age and gender identity, a
                description of your channel, and links to your website or social media profiles.</p>
            <p>

                Additionally, if you register for or access the Services using a Third Party Service (such as your
                social
                media account login credentials), we may receive Personal Data that you have made available to share
                through
                such Third Party Service, which may include, without limitation, your user ID, email, name, and image.
                You
                acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account and providing
                Personal
                Data to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may
                use
                your contact information to send you information about our Services.</p>

            <h3>User Content:</h3>
            <p>
                Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, including Personal Data if
                you
                so choose. User contributions include, but are not limited to, GIFs, written comments, links, and
                pictures.
                All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you
                terminate
                your Account or your access to the Services is terminated. We may continue to disclose such content to
                third
                parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>Information From Others</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, you may be able to register for or access the Services using a Third Party Service,
                such
                as your social media account (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Occasionally, you can also use your Account
                on
                our Services to interact with your accounts on these other services. For example, you may be able to
                access
                posting and sharing tools on the Services that allow you to post information to your social networks
                outside
                of the Services (“Share”). By using these tools, you acknowledge that some information (such as your IP
                address) from your account on the applicable Third Party Service may be transmitted into your Account
                with
                us, in accordance with the policies and your account privacy settings selected through that Third Party
                Service, and that such information and content is covered by this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, if a
                tool,
                such as the Share tool, is operated by a Third Party Service, the Third Party Service that operates the
                tool
                may collect information about your browser or online activity, which would be subject to the Third Party
                Service’s privacy policy and your account settings selected through that Third Party Service. When you
                use
                these tools, some of your information from the Services may be shared with the Third Party Service and
                others. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of any Third Party
                Services, including without limitation any applicable social networks, that you use in connection with
                the
                Services. Additionally, we may collect and receive your applicable Third Party Service login credentials
                in
                connection with providing you with the Services, but only if you expressly provide us with such
                information.
                We will only use such login information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise expressly
                authorized by you.</p>

            <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>
                We automatically receive and record information from your web browser or device when you interact with
                the
                Services, including your IP address, device ID and cookie information. This information is used for
                fighting
                spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services
                (e.g.,
                what links you have clicked on). Your IP address may be used to send you geographically-targeted
                advertisements. Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and
                frequency of visitors to the Site and the Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, for example,
                as
                a statistical measure or in other anonymous forms, but not in a manner that would identify you
                personally.
                This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
                individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>
            <h3>
                Information Collected Using Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                • Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer or device through your web browser
                when
                you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We
                may
                use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the
                Site
                and otherwise use the Services.</p>
            <p>

                • Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data. However, we may match cookies with your
                Personal
                Data to identify you, and we may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of
                the
                Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.</p>
            <p>

                • We may allow third party web analytics service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to
                collect
                information about your use of the Services. We use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc.
                (“Google”) to help us understand how users use the Services and to enhance your experience when you use
                the
                Services. For more information on Google’s privacy practices, please go to
                https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites and to opt out of data recording and analysis by
                Google Analytics on the Services, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
            <p>

                • Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing
                you to
                decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave
                cookies
                active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.</p>
            <p>

                • This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third
                parties.
                We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or device. For example, third
                party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or device.</p>

            <h3>Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons</h3>
            <p>

                To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements through the Services. These
                advertisements
                are sometimes targeted and served to particular users, including using your IP address to send you
                geographically-targeted advertisements, and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad
                networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may
                also
                receive anonymized user data from our Agents (defined below), so we can learn and make enhancements to
                offer
                you a better experience. Some of these entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to
                collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web
                browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information
                may
                be used by us and others to, among other things, tailor the Services to you (for example, by providing
                search results in your preferred language), analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
                content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites
                and
                better understand your online activity. Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to
                users
                who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from
                information provided to us by a user, including Personal Data (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the
                Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services.
                We do
                not provide Personal Data to any ad networks for use outside of the Services. To increase the
                effectiveness
                of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the
                Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and
                reporting
                for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you
                when
                you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons
                from
                the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had
                requested a web page from their site. We may also collect advertising identifiers from your mobile
                device.
                Advertising identifiers are resettable identifiers unique to your mobile device, and which are used in
                connection with advertising delivered to your mobile device. The IDFA (developed by Apple, Inc. for the
                iPhone) and Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android) are examples of advertising identifiers.</p>

            <h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
            <p>
                We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use
                the
                Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Data. This
                statistical
                information is not Personal Data and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, or your web browser.</p>

            <h3>Personal Data of Children</h3>
            <p>
                As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under
                the
                age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal
                Data
                about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13, we
                will
                delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided
                us
                Personal Data, please contact us at csk211@126.com.</p>
            <h3>
                How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</h3>
            <p>
                The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the
                information
                generated through the Services is shared publicly or with Third Party Services. Below further describes
                the
                ways in which we may share your information.</p>

            <h3>Public Information About You and Your Activity on the Services</h3>
            <p>
                User profile and channel information that you choose to provide, including your username, contact name,
                GIFs
                you upload, information about yourself, a description of your channel, and links to your website or
                social
                media profiles, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We
                will
                not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.</p>
            <p>

                Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not
                limited
                to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services. Registered users may
                have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not have this
                association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited)
                may
                be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.</p>
            <p>

                Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Data using certain public features of the
                Services,
                then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be
                publicly
                available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities
                without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We
                therefore
                urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content
                that
                you create or information that you submit through the Services.</p>

            <h3>Information Shared Through Third Party Services</h3>
            <p>
                You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to
                those
                Third Party Services from within our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or
                practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those
                Third
                Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the
                Services.</p>

            <h3>Information Shared In Connection with Related Services</h3>
            <p>
                While we collect and store IP address and device ID information, that information is not made public. We
                do
                at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with
                whom
                we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>
                We also share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we
                conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how
                often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their
                services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us
                non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently
                developed or acquired.</p>

            <h3> Information Shared with Our Agents</h3>
            <p>
                We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who
                are
                under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Data with our Agents in order to provide
                products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use
                Personal Data or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby
                consent to our sharing of Personal Data with our Agents.</p>
            <h3>
                Information Disclosed Pursuant to a Change in Control or Sale</h3>
            <p>
                In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is
                typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets,
                were
                acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
                that
                is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
                acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.</p>

            <h3>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h3>
            <p>
                We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably
                believe
                is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii)
                enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations
                hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to
                user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
                includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
                spam/malware
                prevention.</p>

            <h3>Information We Share With Your Consent</h3>

            <h2> Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                • Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several
                media
                and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better
                understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across
                different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please
                visit
                the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at
                http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
                or www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
            <p>
                • Reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier or set it to opt out of targeted advertising.</p>
            <p>

                • iOS: You can opt-out of targeted advertising by choosing “Limit Ad Tracking” in your device’s settings
                menu.</p>
            <p>

                • Android: You can reset your advertising ID at any time from the Ads section under Settings on your
                device,
                or you can also opt-out of targeting advertising in this same section.</p>
            <p>

                We want you to know that by opting-out of targeted advertising does not mean that you will no longer
                receive
                advertising, but just that the advertising that you do receive will not be customized to you and may
                feel
                less relevant to you.</p>

            <h2> Delete Your Account</h2>
            <p>
                Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing csk211@126.com.
                Please
                note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account. If you terminate
                your
                Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible
                through
                your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account
                prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.</p>

            <h2>How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>
                We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise
                necessary
                to provide you Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to
                comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or
                required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a
                depersonalized
                or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.</p>

            <h2>Is the Information About Me Secure?</h2>
            <p>
                Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to
                prevent
                unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password
                appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished
                accessing your Account.</p>
            <p>

                We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee
                the
                security of any Account information. We store all of our information, including your IP address
                information,
                using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent
                unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise. Unauthorized
                entry
                or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information
                at

            <h2> What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2>

                We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the
                Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If we make changes in the way we
                collect
                or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an
                email. A
                user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes
                have
                been first posted.</p>

            <h2> What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h2>

            <h2>EU Residents</h2>
            <p>
                If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland,
                you
                may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to
                your
                Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>
            <p>

                For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but
                “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and
                “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection,
                use,
                storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the
                Services. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy
                Policy,
                the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such
                conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please

            <p>

                We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for
                processing
                include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of
                others,
                as further described below. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.</p>
            <p>

                • Contractual Necessity:We also process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of
                “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service
                with
                you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual
                necessity,
                failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the
                Services that require such data.</p>

                • Consent: In some cases, we may process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at
                the
                time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly

            <p>

                • Other Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a
                legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if
                it
                is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</p>
            <p>
                Personal Data of Children: We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the
                age of
                16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data
                about
                yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will
                delete
                that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us
                Personal
                Data, please contact us at csk211@126.com.</p>
            <p>

                What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data? You have certain rights with respect to your
                Personal
                Data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request,
                please email csk211@126.com. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to
                fully
                comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the
                rights
                of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify
                you
                of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information,
                which
                may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>
            <p>

                • Access: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy
                of
                such Personal Data.</p>
            <p>

                • Rectification: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or
                incomplete,
                you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information
                directly by updating any of the information contained in your user profile.</p>
            <p>

                • Erasure: You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems.</p>
            <p>

                • Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at
                the
                time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note,
                however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case
                basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary
                to
                enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.</p>
            <p>

                • Portability: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format. You can also
                request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.</p>
            <p>

                • Objection: You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your
                Personal Data for certain purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                • Restriction of Processing: You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.</p>

                the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize us to transfer, store and process your
                information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. Animated Sticker is subject to the
                investigatory
